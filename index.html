                    ## Um, what is Docker?

                    At its core, Docker is a platform for building, running, and managing **containers**.
                    <br><br>
                    #### Q: But what is a container?

                    A: You can think of a container as a **lightweight VM**.

                    Like a VirtualBox or VMWare VM but one that starts very quickly and has **minimal resource overhead**
                    (running an app inside Docker vs on host will barely have any difference in CPU or RAM utilization).

                    ## But why even use a container?

                    Containers were primarily invented to address the issue:

                    *“But it works on my machine!”*

                    Using containers, you can package the dependencies along with the application (like statically linked libraries)
                    which ensures that across all environments*, the program will run the same way.

                    <small style="margin-top: 2rem;">*: Most environments, at least the ones running the same kernel</small>

                    ## So … a container is just a light-weight VM?

                    Sorry, I lied. Internally, it is very different from a typical virtual machine.

                    It’s all just a concoction made of **cgroups** and **namespace** (in Linux) (don’t be scared, we’ll get back to this, I promise)

                    A container runs code on the host OS itself (in the case of Linux, it even uses the same kernel as the host!),
                    therefore it’s limited by the OS it can run on.

                    Whereas a Virtual Machine can run any kernel or OS, and *often* executes software instructions directly on the hardware.

                    ## What in the world is a *cgroup* !?

                    In short, cgroups **control, restrict or account** resources used by processes.
                    Essentially, they can restrict or monitor the memory, CPU, net or disk I/O that can be used by a process.

                    ## Now, what is a *namespace* ?

                    In layman terms, namespaces helps the OS to lie to processes about various things, such as hostname,
                    mounted partitions, users, networks and even the other processes!

                    Whereas `cgroups` limit **how much you can use**, `namespaces` limit **what you can see**.

                    For example, using namespaces, a process might think it’s the initial process (PID 1) and is running as root
                    when in reality it’s an arbitrary process being run by a non-privileged user in the host OS.
                    
                    We'll see how to implement this soon!

                    ## The UTS namespace, aka lying about hostname

                    This namespace is pretty simple: it just changes the hostname that the process sees.

                    For example, your `/etc/hostname` might read “coolsystem” but you can run, say,
                    a database server inside a UTS namespace with the hostname “database”, and it will think its hostname is “database” only.

                        ## The mount namespace, aka lying about filesystem

                        This one is pretty old, and you might be familiar with `chroot` uses it to change the root directory (/).
                        A process inside this namespace cannot see files or folders outside the root folder.

                    ## The net namespace, aka lying about networks

                    This namespace will isolate the network interfaces that are available to a process.

                    Typically, this is used with a pair of virtual interfaces (with the kernel doing some peering magic and acting as a crossover cable).

                    This allows each process to have it’s own IP that is under a NAT and can be port-forwarded to the physical network interface.

                        In a typical Linux system, the initial process (with PID 1) is known as the init process and from it,
                        all other processes spawn as child processes.
                        
                        Using this namespace, you can make a process believe that it is running with PID 1 and is the parent process.

                    ## The IPC namespace, aka lying about … IPC channels

                    Processes can talk to each other in various ways and those ways collectively fall under the Inter Process Communication (IPC).
                    
                    This namespace can restrict the IPC channels that are available to certain processes.
                    
                    Yes, it’s a really obscure thing, let’s not worry about this too much and move on.

                    ## So, how does it all fit together?

                    Containers essentially are just processes with particular namespaces and cgroups attached to them.

                    While containers can be created manually directly from the kernel, this is very tedious
                    and here’s where Docker (and similar tools like LXC come in):
                    1. They create a process
                    2. Then they attach cgroups and a bunch of namespaces onto the process
                    3. And finally they mount filesystems (if any) so that these processes can access files on the host system.

                    ## Now, how exactly does Docker work?

                    Docker is an entire platform for managing, creating, building and deploying containers. It has multiple components, such as:

                    * Client side tools (docker-cli or docker-compose)
                    * Docker daemon
                    * Containerd daemon
                    * Runc
                    * Registry

                    ## Client-Side Tools

                    There are several client side tools that can be used to manage Docker containers,
                    the most famous ones being the Docker CLI and Docker Compose.
                    
                    1. The **Docker CLI** is the builtin “default” tool that’s used for running, creating, building or managing single containers.
                    2. Whereas **Docker-Compose** is used to run, build or manage multiple containers together
                    (for example, a web server container and a database container together).

                    ## Docker Daemon

                    The Docker daemon does all the heavy lifting of building, running or distributing containers.
                    It communicates with the client either with a REST API, over UNIX sockets or on a network interface.

                    A good analogy would be to think of the **Docker daemon** as the **backend of a website** which handles
                    all the logic whereas the **client tools** to be the **frontend** with which the user interfaces.

                    The Docker daemon can either be run on the local machine (on which the client exists) or on a remote server.

                    ## Containerd

                    It is a high-level container runtime, that is, it actually pulls the images from the registries, manages them,
                    and then passes it to a lower-level runtime (such as runC) for creation.

                    The Docker daemon internally uses containerd to manage the containers.

                    It manages (monitors) the lifecycle of containers. It is a long running daemon that continually monitors the status of the containers.

                    ## RunC

                    This is the low-level container runtime that *actually* runs and creates containers.
                    It is responsible for creating the actual namespaces and cgroups needed to run a container.

                    It is based on `libcontainer` which is a Go-based implementation for creating containers.

                    It is a short lived process that dies after creating a container leaving a long-running process
                    called a shim in place that connects the container with containerd.
